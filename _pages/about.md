Hi there 👋!

My name is Guancheng Wan (万冠呈), I'm currently a junior undergraduate student at the [School of Computer Science](https://cs.whu.edu.cn/), [Wuhan University (WHU)](https://www.whu.edu.cn/), fortunately supervised by [Prof. Mang Ye](https://marswhu.github.io/index.html). My research interest lies in graph mining and federated learning. I made efforts to build an efficient, scalable and robust system for learning graph-strctured data.



<!-- My research interest lies in Artificial Intelligence (AI) Security & Privacy, where I explore the weakness of Deep Learning models in their lifecycles (e.g., Adversarial Attack, Backdoor Attack) and their countermeasures. I also made efforts on turning these weaknesses into good use, applying on privacy protection and Intellectual Property (IP) protection of deep learning models. It's a fortune to be supervised by Prof. [Run Wang](http://wangrun.github.io/) during my study on AI. During my undergraduate study, I also enjoyed a great time conducting research on  Geoinformatics and Remote Sensing, in which I worked closely with my teammates [Jiahao Zhou](https://ddakun.github.io/) and [Sixing Lin](https://defaultlin.cn/). -->

<!-- I have won the First Class Scholarship of WHU 2 times (5% school-wide), the HUANG Zhangren Scholarship (60 candidates per year in WHU), the Huawei Scholarship (54 candidates per year in WHU), the National Scholarship (0.2% national-wide), and was selected the Pacemaker to Merit Student of WHU (60 candidates per year in WHU).  -->

🌟 I'm currently actively seeking for Ph.D., Research Assistant, or internship positions related to Graph Learning. I'm also open to any possible discussions or collaborate opportunities. If you're interested in working with me, don't hesitate to drop me an email! 

My curriculum vitae (**CV**) can be downloaded [here (in English)]().
