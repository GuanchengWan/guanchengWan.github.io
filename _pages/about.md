Hi there üëã!

My name is Guancheng Wan (‰∏áÂÜ†Âëà), I'm currently a junior undergraduate student at the [School of Computer Science](https://cs.whu.edu.cn/), [Wuhan University (WHU)](https://www.whu.edu.cn/), fortunately supervised by [Prof. Mang Ye](https://marswhu.github.io/index.html). My research interest lies in graph mining. I made efforts to build an efficient, scalable, trustworthy, and robust system for learning graph-structured data.




üåü I'm currently actively seeking for Ph.D., Research Assistant, or internship positions related to Graph Learning. I'm also open to any possible discussions or collaborate opportunities. If you're interested in working with me, don't hesitate to drop me an email! 

My curriculum vitae (**CV**) can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/GuanchengWan/guanchengWan.github.io/raw/master/docs/GuanchengWan_cv.pdf). 

# üîé Research 
I am enthusiastic about immersing myself in the field of artificial intelligence, particularly focusing on graph data. Currently, my research interests revolve around three primary areas: a) Federated Graph Learning, b) Graph Unsupervised Learning, and c) Graph Learning with LLMs.

# üî• News

- *2023.12:* A paper was accepted to AAAI2024. See you in Vancouver.

- *2023.10:* I attended China National Computer Congress (CNCC) and was awarded the honor of CCF (China Computer Federation) Elite Collegiate Award (102 Students nation-wide).

- *2023.10:* I won the National Scholarship for the second time (0.2% nation-wide), and was selected the Pacemaker to Merit Student  (Award Rate: 60/59774=0.1%).

- *2023.08:* We attended *The 32nd INTERNATIONAL JOINT
CONFERENCE ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (IJCAI)* and presented our work in Macao.
